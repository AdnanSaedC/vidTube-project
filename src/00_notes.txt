mongodb allows bith prehooks and posthook

prehooks things you want to do before saving something into database
posthook after saving stuffs into the database

//aggregation pipeline
pipeline is just stages and each stage performs some operration on the input data
and the output of each stage is the input of the next stage

[
    {pipeline1},
    {pipeline2},
    {pipeline3},
]

//now each pipeline
{
    $opration:{}
}

example join opration in mongodb
{
    $lookup:{
        foreigndbname:"teacher"
        localid:"Tid"
        foreignId:"EmpID"
        nameOftheConnection:"relation between stu and techaer"

        //refer the docs for correct syntax
    }
}
here you will get the output in array to convert it into objcet
{
    $addfield:{
        "connection":{
            $first:nameOftheConnection
            }
    }
}

//in mongodb the field represent something which has both key and value pair

pipeline ontains operators [op1,op2]
if you are using a variable from the document you have to mention $

some functions are $sum,$min,$max,$avg

format
[
    {
        $function($group):{
            name:{
                $sum:"$age"
            },
            _id:"$age"
        }
    }
]

you can also use limit to limit the number of respose you get
and since limit is a function you have at add $

syntax $function, "$variable"

you can also use $skip to skip the number of documents you want to skip and it will skip from the first

limit and skip is used in displaying pages in serach results
$unwind is used to expand the docs based on value

ex adnan:{
    language :[urdu,english]
}

$unwind:"$language"

output
ex adnan:{
    language :urdu
}
ex adnan:{
    language :english
}


$match:{
    language: /^c/
}

starts with c

//whatever may be the case you will get id = objectId(string)

$project:{
    newName:"$varibale"
}
