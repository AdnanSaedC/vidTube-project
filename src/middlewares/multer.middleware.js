// what we are trying to do here is we are extracting the files from req and storing it in local storage
import multer from "multer"


//here insted of req,res,next we have req,file,cb
//here req is req url ,file is the data u got and cb is what to do with that data
//here cb(null,path)
//null means no error

//now we are going to save the files in the cloudnary
